## Authentication Fix Summary

### âœ… **Fixed Customer Login Issue**
- **Problem**: Only admin email (jesust9140@gmail.com) was allowed to login, blocking all customers

- Added "Log In" button for existing users
- Better visual consistency with login form

### âœ… **Improved Route Protection**
- Updated `ProtectedRoute.jsx` to handle admin-only routes
- Dashboard is now strictly limited to jesust9140@gmail.com
- Non-admin users are redirected to their profile page if they try to access dashboard

### âœ… **Role-Based Access Control**
- **Admin** (jesust9140@gmail.com): Can access dashboard and all features
- **Customers**: Can access profile/inventory, notifications, but NOT dashboard
- Added `requireAdmin` middleware for future backend dashboard routes

### âœ… **User Experience Improvements**
- Clear error messages for authentication failures
- Smooth navigation between login/register forms
- Visual feedback for different user roles
